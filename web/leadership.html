                    <p>A father to two children, Karun is an immigrant of Indian descent. He is a strong proponent of
                        high education standards during every phase of a child’s development and a staunch believer in
                        equal opportunity for minorities and women in every segment of society. With a background in
                        engineering, finance and management, he gave up a lucrative and influential career to support
                        his wife in her pursuit of advanced training in medicine. It is during this sabbatical that he
                        dealt with the challenges of finding high quality child care for his children, and eventually
                        started Ratingsville.</p>

                    <p>Karun has thoroughly enjoyed staying home with his children since their birth and has taken a
                        very active role in their upbringing. In fact, his vision for Ratingsville is driven by the
                        desire to provide parents more time and opportunity, amid demanding work schedules, to stay
                        actively engaged in the development and education of their children. </p>

                    <p>Karun holds a bachelor's degree in Chemical Engineering from Columbia University and a master's degree in
                        Business Administration from the Darden School of Business (University of Virginia). He
                        is an avid cook and wine enthusiast and currently resides in New York.</p>
