<h4>Information We Collect and How We Use It</h4>
<h5>Among the Information We Collect, You Must Note the Following:</h5>

        such as your name, phone number, email, postal address, and possibly information relating to certain support or customer
        service issues. In many cases, we need this information to provide to you many of the services that you may have requested.
        We may use some of your personal information, such as mobile phone number and email, to verify your identity and authenticate
        your profile. This helps all users of the Site and Services as they know that those who create accounts and post information
        are genuine users.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Social Media Information:</b> We may use your social media information to verify your identity and authenticate your profile.
        This helps all users of the Site and Service as they know that those who create accounts and post information are genuine users.

        zip code, and other information you may provide with your account, such as your gender and birth date. Your initials, as well as any photo
        you submit through the registration process, will be publicly displayed as part of your account profile, especially next to any reviews
        you submit or any questions you address for other Ratingsville customers. You will also have an option to set an alias which may be displayed
        in lieu of your initials where appropriate, especially next to any reviews you submit or any questions you address for other customers of the

        <b>Cellular Phone Numbers: <u><i>By providing a cellular telephone number to us, you expressly consent to, and authorize us or a third party on
            our behalf to deliver autodialed or prerecorded telemarketing calls and/or text messages to the number you provide.</i></u></b> You are not
        required to consent to these calls as a condition to purchasing any services, but withholding your consent may prevent us from providing
        certain services to you.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Other Relevant Information:</b> We may, from time to time, require you to submit other relevant information that establishes proof of your
        interaction with the party you have chosen to rate and review (“Reviewee”) on our Site and Services. We may share such proof of interaction
        only with the Reviewee, and only to establish the validity of the proof you submit. Such proof of interaction may be provided to us in
        redacted format (i.e., all sensitive information blacked out) so long as the information that is relevant to your interaction with the Reviewee
        is clearly visible and legible.  We do not, and will never, authorize the Reviewee to share such proof of interaction further with any other party.
        However, we cannot control Reviewees’ actions regarding further sharing or distribution of the proof you submit to us, and therefore expressly
        disclaim any and all liability, without limitation, for the actions of Reviewees.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Submission of Reviews, Ratings, and Comments:</b> We collect information that you voluntarily provide as part of our Site and Services, including

        shared with others, you should not submit User Generated Content, or should not submit User Generated Content that contains information or Personal
        Information you do not want shared in this manner. Once You have submitted User Generated Content, we reserve the right to publish it in any medium to others.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Aggregate Information:</b> We may collect general, non-personal, statistical information about the use of the Site and Services, such as how many
        visitors visit a specific page on the Site, how long they stay on that page, and which hyperlinks, if any, they click on. This information represents
        a generic overview of our users, including their collective viewing habits, and allows us and other third parties to modify information, promotions, offers
        and/or discounts on products and services based on user traffic and behavior. We collect this information through the use of technologies such as 'cookies'
        and web beacons, which are discussed in greater detail below. We collect this information in order to help enhance the Site and Services to make for a
        better visitor experience.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Third Party Information:</b> We may supplement information you provide to us with information from other sources, such as information to validate or
        update your address, payment card or other demographic and lifestyle information. We use this information to help us maintain the accuracy of the information
        we collect, to enable us to fulfill our products and services, to target our communications so that we can inform you of products, services and offers
        that may be of interest, and for internal business analysis or other business purposes consistent with our mission.

    <li>
        <p>
            <b>Cookies:</b> We, and third parties with whom we partner, may use cookies, web beacons, tags, scripts, local shared objects such as HTML5 and Flash
            (sometimes called "flash cookies"), advertising identifiers (including mobile identifiers such as Apple’s IDFA or Google’s Advertising ID) and similar technology
            <b>("Cookies")</b> in connection with your use of the Site and Services, third party websites, and mobile applications. Cookies may have unique identifiers,
            and reside, among other places, on your computer or mobile device, in emails we send to you, and on our web pages. Cookies may transmit information about you

                <td>
                    Intended to make advertising more relevant to users and more valuable to advertisers.

            <b>Managing Cookies:</b> It may be possible to disable some (but not all) Cookies through your device or browser settings, but doing so may affect the functionality
            of the Site and Services. The method for disabling Cookies may vary by device and browser, but can usually be found in preferences or security settings.
            For example, iOS and Android devices each have settings which are designed to limit forms of ad tracking. Please note that changing any of these settings does
            not prevent the display of all advertisements to you.
        </p>
        To learn more, or to opt-out of receiving online display advertisements tailored to your interests by our third party partners, visit the Network
        Advertising Initiative at <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org" target="_blank">www.networkadvertising.org</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Other Tracking Technologies:</b> Tracking technologies may record information such as Internet domain and host names; protocol (IP) addresses; browser software
        and operating system types; clickstream patterns; the MAC address or other technical information from your mobile device; location information through GPS, WiFi,
        Bluetooth, or similar technologies, and dates and times that our Site and Services are accessed. An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your
        computer whenever you are surfing the web. Web servers, the computers that 'serve up' webpages, automatically identify your computer by its IP address.
        The Site and Services may also use technology called "tracer tags". These may also be referred to as "Pixels", "Clear GIFs" or "Web Beacons". This technology
        allows us to understand which pages you visit on our Site and other ways you interact with our Site and Services, such as purchases made through the Site and Services.
        These tracer tags are used to help us to optimize and tailor our Site and Services for you and other users of our Site and Services. We may link the information we
        record using tracking technologies to Personal Information we collect.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Do Not Track:</b> Do Not Track (DNT) is a privacy preference that users can set in some web browsers, allowing users to opt out of tracking by websites and
        online services. At the present time, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) has not yet established universal standards for recognizable DNT signals and therefore,
        Ratingsville and the Site do not recognize DNT.
    </li>

        information about your call with the business that the business would have received had you called them directly, such as the date and time of your call and your phone number.
