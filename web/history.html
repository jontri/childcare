            <p>It wasn’t long ago when my wife and I embarked on a series of relocations across the country for professional reasons. With each move came the task of finding child care for our kids that we felt comfortable with. The search for a suitable place to enroll our children was rather daunting, regardless of which city or town we moved to. Lack of information online on nearby child care centers, unreturned voicemails, tedious application processes and long wait lists were only some of the challenges we faced in our quest to find a good place, one where we felt our children would be safe and grow with appropriate attention to their physical, intellectual and emotional needs.</p>
            <p>This need for a more reliable, convenient and efficient process to finding good child care led to the formation of Ratingsville, an online platform where parents can get access to relevant information on child care centers of interest and connect with them in a more efficient format. But we didn’t just stop at that. We also felt the need to help child care centers optimize their own operations and connect effectively with existing and prospective customers, and are doing so while maintaining our position as an independent third party. After all, a better run child care center translates into a higher quality, more cost effective proposition for parents and a superior place for children.</p>
            <p>We started Ratingsville in 2015 and have since been diligently working to develop an online infrastructure to make Ratingsville’s services available to parents and child care centers. To achieve this, we strive to recruit competent, ethical and compassionate individuals for whom the prospect of making positive contributions to their communities gives purpose to their lives.</p>
            <p>The rest is not history. The rest, the best, is yet to come. Won’t you ride with us into the future for a better way to child care?</p>
