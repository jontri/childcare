        <b>Service Providers</b>
        <p>
            Ratingsville does not endorse and is not responsible or liable for any Content, data,
            advertising, products, goods or services available or unavailable from, or through, any
            third party or Service Provider. You agree that should you use or rely on such Content,
            data, advertisement, products, goods or services, available or unavailable from, or
            through any third party or Service Provider, Ratingsville is not responsible or liable,
            indirectly or directly, for any damage or loss caused or alleged to be caused by or in
            connection with such use or reliance. Your dealings with, or participation in promotions
            of any Service Provider, and any other terms, conditions, representations or warranties
            associated with such dealings, are between you and such Service Provider exclusively
            and do not involve Ratingsville. You should make whatever investigation or other
            resources that you deem necessary or appropriate before hiring or engaging Service
            Providers. Someone else's assessment of the same Service Provider may be very
            different, or be based upon different information. A Ratingsville rating is not an
            endorsement of any particular Service Provider, and is not a guarantee of a Service
            Provider's quality or competency. Rather, the Ratingsville rating is intended to be a
            starting point, based on input from other third parties (both organizations and
            individuals), to gather information about Service Providers who may be suitable for your
            needs - but you should not rely solely on the Ratingsville rating in deciding whether to
            contact or hire any given Service Provider.
        </p>
        <p>
            Third parties and Service Providers may link or otherwise direct Internet users to our

            Service Provider websites while on these third party or Service Provider websites is

            Ratingsville's policies. It is your responsibility to review such third party or Service
            Provider policies, including any relevant privacy policies. You agree that Ratingsville will
            not be responsible or liable for, and does not endorse any content, advertising, goods or

            conditions, warranties, or representations associated with such dealings, are solely
            between you and such Service Provider. You agree that Ratingsville shall not be
            responsible or liable, directly or indirectly, for any loss or damage of any sort incurred as
            the result of any such dealings or as the result of the presence of such third parties or

            to Ratingsville.

            All provisions of the Terms of Use which by their nature should survive termination shall

        <b>Notice and Procedure for Making Claims of Copyright Infringement</b>
        <p>
            Ratingsville respects the intellectual property of others. It is our policy to respond quickly
            to genuine claims of intellectual property infringement, including copyright. We will
            quickly process and investigate notices of alleged infringement and will take proper
            actions under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA") and other applicable
            intellectual property laws. Upon receipt of notices complying or substantially complying
            with the notice requirements of the DMCA, we may act quickly to remove or disable
            access to any material which may be infringing or claimed to be the subject of infringing
            activity and may act expeditiously to remove or disable access to any reference or link
            to material or activity that is claimed to be infringing. We may terminate access for
            users of the Site and Service who are infringers.

            Please note that you may be liable for damages (including costs and attorneys’ fees) if you materially misrepresent that an activity is infringing your

        <b>Governing Law</b>
        <p>
            These Terms of Use and the relationship between you and Ratingsville will be governed
            by the laws of the State of Florida, notwithstanding the choice of law provisions of the
            venue where any action is brought, where the violation occurred, where you may be
            located or any other jurisdiction. You agree and consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of
            the state or federal courts located in Orange County, Florida and waive any defense of
            lack of personal jurisdiction or improper venue or forum non conveniens to a claim

            limited to, direct, consequential, and punitive damages and injunctive relief.
            Ratingsville's remedies are cumulative and not exclusive. Failure of Ratingsville to
            exercise any remedy or enforce any portion of the Terms of Use at any time shall not
